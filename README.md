# Math Converter
*Converter for educational purposes letting the students quickly convert math's tasks*

Complementary tasks are going to be added here for the students, easily to manage through the student's ID.

##Architecture

Designed and build with the `NodeJS` architecture on **back-end** having `Exprees` providing **API RESTful** and `MongoDB` as **NoSQL** **database** service *JSON* formated.

It counts with the *Superheroic* framework on  `AngularJS` enchancing **front-end** *services and directives purposes*.

##Getting started

On the root you can identify the `app.js` and notice the *app* is run on the *public* folder.

The building process also occurs into that folder. **Read** `Gruntfile.js`.

1. Building Process

  * Dev build `grunt dev` is registered
    * `uglify`
    * `JSHint`
    * `cssmin`
    * `SASS`
    * `dev-deploy`

  * Stage build `grunt stage` is unregistered  
    * `uglify`
    * `JSHint`
    * `cssmin`
    * `SASS`
    * `stage-deploy`

  * Production build `grunt production` is unregistered  
    * `uglify`
    * `JSHint`
    * `cssmin`
    * `SASS`
    * `prod-deploy`

2. For public compiling, **not for the build** - `compass`

  * SASS pre-compile process for the source
    * `compass watch path/to/the/themes/`

3. `node app.js` would start the application if everything is fine.        
  * `localhost:3412` is the default port.
